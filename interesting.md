[Why TLS 1.3 isn't in browsers yet](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/) - An interesting read on how hard it is to design long lasting protocols for the web. Demonstrates a phenomenon in protocol design called ossification. Implementers implement to the reality of the protocol, not the intention of the protocol’s designer or the text of the specification. In complex ecosystems with multiple implementers, unused joints rust shut.

[First practical attempts to penetrate the virgin domain of hardware evolution](https://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/) - The concept is roughly analogous to Charles Darwin’s elegant principle of natural selection, which describes how individuals with the most advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. This process tends to preserve favorable characteristics by passing them to the survivors’ descendants, while simultaneously suppressing the spread of less-useful traits.

Dr. Thompson dabbled with computer circuits in order to determine whether survival-of-the-fittest principles might provide hints for improved microchip designs.
